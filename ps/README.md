## MCDS @ CMU

__The application requires a statement of purpose. What makes a good essay?__  
We are looking for strong, experience-based evidence that you can do well in our degree program and that you “fit” based on our areas of focus. For example, a description of a large software or research project, your involvement in the project, and the impact of the research is good evidence. An explanation of what drew your interest to the MCDS program and how it relates to your professional goals is also useful. You may also take this opportunity to explain any apparent weaknesses in your application. Although details regarding your personal interests and background can be helpful, they are not part of our admissions criteria and should not constitute the bulk of your statement of purpose. Most importantly, your statement of purpose should be written by you and provide an accurate representation of your experiences and goals.

## CS @ UTAustin

This document should explain your rationale for obtaining a graduate degree in Computer Science -- your research interests, what you bring to the program, and how you hope to use the degree. This is __not a "life story"__, but be sure to cover any aspects of your application/background that might need additional explanation. Remember that readers of your statement are CS researchers, but not necessarily in your area!

## Connective Media @ Cornell Tech

Here at Cornell Tech, you will take part in an innovative environment where creativity, technical depth and leadership share seats at the table. We value expressions of who you are and what you add to this formula. Please submit a __one- or two-page__ statement that describes your interest in the Technion-Cornell Dual Masters Degree in Connective Media. Your submission should highlight personal experiences that demonstrate your creativity, leadership and technical abilities. In particular, feel free to elaborate on technical projects you have completed, their creative and technical aspects; any entrepreneurial or leadership experiences; future goals and the benefit you envision from being part of the tech ecosystem in New York City and the Connective Media Program.

- __Option 2:__
Cornell Tech has a builder culture: our students get their hands dirty developing real digital products, and many of our students have prior software development experience. Have you ever developed a complete software application before (i.e., an end-to-end application that has a user interface, one or more web services, a database, etc)? If so, describe that application and your experience making it.
